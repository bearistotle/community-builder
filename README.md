## What It Is

An app for apartments/communal living spaces to help facilitate organic development of friendships. 

## What It Does

The residents of an apartment building or complex can input activities that they enjoy as well as general times that they're available to do them. If the right number of users sign up for similar activities within the same time slot, the app will notify them and ask if they'd like to participate. Users will also have the ability to create singular events--for example, a Superbowl watch party or a Smash Bros tournament in the common room. Finally, the app will incorporate some sort payment feature, where users can chip in for food, drink, and other activity costs. The creator of the event will set a cap and attendees can decide what to pay. If the cap is met, the funds will be transferred to the creator (or a designated treasurer) who will make the necessary purchases (some form of reviews or receipt uploads will need to be incorporated to keep people honest here).


## Why It's Needed

I believe there is a growing crisis of loneliness in America. We are connected to more and more people, but in shallower and shallower ways, and we are increasingly doing things alone (see, for evidence, Robert Putnam's 2000 book, "Bowling Alone"). This is contrary to our nature as social beings and is a partial cause of the uptick in unhealthy drug use and depression in recent decades, despite enormous growth in material prosperity and the availability of all sorts of wonderful hobbies, sports, travel destinations, etc. As Louie C.K. said, "Everything's amazing and nobody's happy." 

I think about this crisis of loneliness a lot and one day, as I was shooting pool alone in a building full of people, I asked myself why my apartment building was so different from my college dorm, where it was **so** easy to make friends. Then it hit me: The clear availability and willingness of those around me to participate in things we'd both enjoy. In an apartment building, people do not leave their doors open and there is not the pervasive sense that people want to make friends and are available to do fun things. This creates a sort of social block to forming friendships. Apartment buildings try to foster community through sponsored events, usually some free food and booze in the common room or by the pool, but such events nearly always feel forced and generate few real friendships.

My app seeks to foster real community in an organic way, in the way we all grew up forming friendships: through fun, shared activities. By connecting residents based on what they've said they enjoy and when they are available, the app makes the first move, so to speak, and lowers the psychological cost of asking an unknown resident to, say, shoot a game of pool because (i) the connection is made by a third party and (ii) the other resident is known to enjoy the activity. It will be far less awkward (and thus far more likely) for people to meet up to do something together and get to know each other as they engage in the shared activity than it is to try to make small talk with a total stranger at building sponsored events or in passing in the hallways. The shared activity gives a sort of direction to the interaction and takes some pressure off of the conversation, while also providing fodder for conversation itself. I believe that if large apartment buildings used this app to connect residents, there would be far fewer lonely people and far more meaningful friendships. 

From the property manager/landlord's perspective, the app provides significant value in three ways (i) by enhancing the quality of life of the residents, which makes it more likely that they won't move out and increases the amount they are willing to pay to live in the building, and (ii) by increasing the efficiency of dollars spent on building-wide events, as the data on what activities residents enjoy allows property managers to create events they know residents will want to come to and the availability for residents to create and crowdfund events means that successful, building-wide events can be scheduled at no cost to the property manager, and (iii) decreasing the need to plan and fund community-building events, as the community is built organically by residents using the app.
